Here's a quick guide on what's **tagterm** all about and how to install
and/or use it alongside your project.

Tagterm
-------

*Tagterm* name stands for tag terminator, which is a piece of software
capable of:

    * validating & repairing HTML files
    * converting them into XHTML format
    * removing unwanted tags while keeping the content

In order to use it, you'll have to install the current project, then to build
an executable (or not) from the main script or just use the currently
available ones inside the *bin* directory.
For more details about this process, please read
:ref:`installation <installation>` and :ref:`usage <usage>`.
